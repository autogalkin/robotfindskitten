## About <a name = "about"></a>

`robotfindskitten` is an example of an open-world 2D top-down game that runs within the standard Windows notepad.exe application. The game engine uses DLL injection to modify the notepad.exe process at startup and make the following changes:

- Replaces the default Win32 EditControl with Scintilla, which is used in notepad++
- Updates the notepad.exe message processing mechanism from GetMessageW to PeekMessageW, providing a modern way to implement a fixed-time-step game loop
- Hooks the standard keyboard and mouse inputs to allow for player interaction
- Removes Notepad's main menu and status bar, and changes the window title to fit the game's context

The game in Notepad is based on an entity-component-system and supports:
- an open world
- a night-day cycle
- UTF-8 symbols for shapes
- multi-symbol big shapes
- collision detection based on a Quadtree algorithm
- pseudo non-uniform movement for projectiles that explode into fragments upon impact

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This project only works on Windows and has only been tested on x64 platforms. It uses C++20. To build from source:
### Prerequisites

The project uses vcpkg to manage dependencies, and depends on several libraries:

- boost (signals2, container)
- EnTT
- Eigen3
- utfcpp
- range-v3

### Getting robotfindskitten

Please note that the robotfindskitten depends on a scintilla submodule. The simplest way to clone it is:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:autogalkin/robotfindskitten.git 
```

### Build

The project uses CMake, and the CMakePresets contain a preset based on Ninja and MSVC

```
cmake --build --preset x64-debug --target all install
```

Binary files will be located in the */bin* directory. You need to run loader.exe


Enjoy!
